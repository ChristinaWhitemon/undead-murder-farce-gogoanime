## In a world inhabited by vampires, golems, werewolves and other creatures, Aya Rindo, along with Tsugaru Shunichi and Shizuku Hasei, travels as supernatural detective, solving mysteries while she looks for her lost body

***Undead murder farce is a treat for all fans of fantasy and mystery. The basic premise is that a severed head and her two assistants go around solving mysteries, very reminiscent of classic Holmes stories***

*There are a few twists on the classic formula, however:*

+  Firstly, most of the mysteries involve fantasy creatures in their deductions, leading to an incredibly intriguing set of cases

+  Secondly, is that the characters are also constantly getting developed and we are able to see their worldviews, personalities, and relationships change

+  Finally, there is also a lot more fighting than in a typical detective story. This is largely because of a few different groups that are very shounenesque in their design

Each member of these groups has different abilities and we get to see how their different abilities interact during their fight scenes. The fight scenes are often short, but well animated, with them certainly being a secondary attraction to the cases themselves. The cases are well paced as well, with each one providing enough time for the audience to get invested into the characters and overall mystery being presented. On top of all this, Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty and major players, so look forward to seeing them in a world filled with monsters!
